--free-space=size    Add given amount of free space to the volume. Size is in
                     bytes, suffixes are k(i), m(i) and g(i). For instance set 
                     size to "200m" to add 200,000,000 or set it to "100ki" to
                     add 102,400 bytes of space.
--store-full-path    Store full directory paths down to the root of each file
                     system, expect the root entry (e.g. drive letters).
--label=name         Name of the volume, up to 15 characters long.
--skip-empty-dirs    Don't add directories which are completely empty.
--allow-merge        If name conflicts happen, due to overlapping directories
                     or file structures, then merge the entries by replacing
                     with the rightmost set of the directories declared.
--case-merge         Support file and folder names in a case-sensitive fashion
                     when it comes to potential conflicts while merging.
--overwrite          Overwrite the volume if it already exists. Caution!
--block-cipher=name  Name of the cipher algorithm to use (AES256).
--hash-function=name Name of the hash function to use (RIPEMD-160).
--keep-broken-volume Keep the (potentially incomplete) volume file after an
                     error occurred.
--password=password  The password to use, instead of entering manually.
--wipe               Securely erase the original files and folders after the
                     volume has been created successfully.
--wipe-only          Just securely erase objects, do not create a container.
--extract            Extract the given volume to the given location.
--invalidate         Invalidate the given volume. Use with caution!

          trupax --wipe -r --password=abc123 backup.tc /home/alice/
          trupax -v --free-space=2g photolib.tc "My Pictures\2010"
          trupax -v --extract C:\Users\jane\secure\reports.tc D:\temp
